<h3 id="determining-hardware-requirements">Determining Hardware Requirements</h3>
<p>The specifications of the machine running the Secure Gateway Client is largely dependent on the traffic that will be passing through each connection.  Each client instance is an individual process that provides up to 250 concurrent connections.  To approximate an average maximum that the machine would need to support, determine the average size of a transaction across the client (both request and response) and then scale that to 250 concurrent transactions.  Given that this number has combined both request and response sizes, the client should not exceed this memory footprint.  For more precise estimates, a mixture of request sizes and response sizes should be used to better simulate a real-world transaction scenario.</p>
<p>For running a single instance of the Secure Gateway Client, we suggest a minimum of 2 cores and 4 GB of memory.<br>For HA scenarios that will be running multiple instances of the client on the same machine, we suggest a minimum of 4 cores and 8 GB of memory.</p>

<ol>
<li>Mount the DMG image that was downloaded from the Secure Gateway UI, normally by &#39;double-clicking&#39; it.</li>
<li>A new &#39;finder&#39; window should appear.  This window should contain an Applications &quot;shortcut&quot; icon, drag and drop the application onto the shortcut.  If not, &#39;double-click&#39; the mounted volume and drag and drop the application icon to the Applications icon in the Finder sidebar.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Beginning with version 1.3.0, the Secure Gateway client provides native client installation support for selected Linux environments. A native running client will improve over-all performance in both bare metal and virtual environments. You can run the natively installed client by using the system auto-start facility or manually by using a terminal session. When you use the auto-start facility, the client automatically logs events to the defined /var/log directory and file.</p>
<p>The installation includes the IBM Secure Gateway client as well as a secure version of IBM&#39;s nodejs package.  Both are installed under the /opt/ibm directory on the system.  The installer will create or update the following:</p>

<p>The user can run the client either manually in a terminal session or by using the built-in upstart capability.</p>
<h4 id="ubuntu-installation-procedure">Ubuntu Installation Procedure</h4>
<p>You will require root or administrative privileges to perform this installation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install the Secure Gateway client. For example, if you are using a Debian package, issue the following command.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are trying to install 1.4.1 version use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i ibm-securegateway-client-1.4.1+client_amd64.deb
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When the client installer starts, you are prompted for the following information.</p>
<p><b>Auto-start process Yes/No</b></p>
<pre><code>If this is an upgrade or reinstall, you must choose whether you want the existing client to be stopped while
the installation process is running. Choose Y/y to stop the existing client. Otherwise, the client package
is upgraded without restarting the client, which means that you can wait for an appropriate Software Update
window to perform a restart. If you choose N/n, the installation continues and you must restart the client
manually.
</code></pre><p><b>Gateway ID</b></p>
<pre><code>Set the gateway ID for the client. The gateway ID is defined when you create a Secure Gateway service. If the
client fails to connect, you can change your selection by editing the .conf file.
</code></pre><p><b>Security token</b></p>
<pre><code>If the gateway ID is enabled to check for a security token, you must provide it now. If the gateway ID does
not require a security token, leave this blank.
</code></pre><p><b>Logging level</b></p>
<pre><code>The default setting is INFO. Other valid values are TRACE, DEBUG, and ERROR.
</code></pre><p><b>Access Control List</b></p>
<pre><code>Enter the absolute path of the file name containing the access control list on what has access to your
on-premises resources. For more information, see the README.md file in /opt/ibm/securegateway or Access control list.
</code></pre><p><b>Client UI</b></p>
<pre><code>Choose if you want to use client UI. If yes, user can change the port for the UI. Default value is 9003.
</code></pre><p><b>Note:</b> You do not have to answer any of the prompts, all will take the defined default or be left blank in the sgenvironment.conf file. This allows the installation process to run without user interaction.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The sgenvironment.conf is read every time that you start or restart the client using the system&#39;s upstart process. You can edit the /etc/ibm/sgenvironment.conf file at any time to make changes to your configuration and restart the client to pick up those changes.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The language of the Secure Gateway client service logs can be changed by changing the <code>LANGUAGE</code> parameter in the /etc/ibm/sgenvironment.conf file. The service logs will change to selected language after service restart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you restarted the client, to make sure that the client is running properly, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>cat /var/log/securegateway/client_console.log
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you want to edit the configuration file, to make sure that the configuration file is updated correctly, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo vi /etc/ibm/sgenvironment.conf
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To check the status of your client installation, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dpkg --status ibm-securegateway-client
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>An example of the output is returned:</p>

<p>Beginning 1.4.2, installer will be available for Power. You will require root or administrative privileges to perform this installation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install the Secure Gateway client. For instance, if you are trying to install 1.4.2 version use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i ibm-securegateway-client-1.4.2+client_ppc64el.deb
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When the client installer starts, you are prompted for the following information.</p>
<p><b>Auto-start process Yes/No</b></p>
<pre><code>If this is an upgrade or reinstall, you must choose whether you want the existing client to be stopped while
the installation process is running. Choose Y/y to stop the existing client. Otherwise, the client package
is upgraded without restarting the client, which means that you can wait for an appropriate Software Update
window to perform a restart. If you choose N/n, the installation continues and you must restart the client
manually.
</code></pre><p><b>Gateway ID</b></p>
<pre><code>Set the gateway ID for the client. The gateway ID is defined when you create a Secure Gateway service. If the
client fails to connect, you can change your selection by editing the .conf file.
</code></pre><p><b>Security token</b></p>
<pre><code>If the gateway ID is enabled to check for a security token, you must provide it now. If the gateway ID does
not require a security token, leave this blank.
</code></pre><p><b>Logging level</b></p>
<pre><code>The default setting is INFO. Other valid values are TRACE, DEBUG, and ERROR.
</code></pre><p><b>Access Control List</b></p>
<pre><code>Enter the absolute path of the file name containing the access control list on what has access to your
on-premises resources. For more information, see the README.md file in /opt/ibm/securegateway or Access control list.
</code></pre><p><b>Client UI</b></p>
<pre><code>Choose if you want to use client UI. If yes, user can change the port for the UI. Default value is 9003.
</code></pre><p><b>Note:</b> You do not have to answer any of the prompts, all will take the defined default or be left blank in the sgenvironment.conf file. This allows the installation process to run without user interaction.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The sgenvironment.conf is read every time that you start or restart the client using the system&#39;s upstart process. You can edit the /etc/ibm/sgenvironment.conf file at any time to make changes to your configuration and restart the client to pick up those changes.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The language of the Secure Gateway client service logs can be changed by changing the <code>LANGUAGE</code> parameter in the /etc/ibm/sgenvironment.conf file. The service logs will change to selected language after service restart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you restarted the client, to make sure that the client is running properly, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>cat /var/log/securegateway/client_console.log
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you want to edit the configuration file, to make sure that the configuration file is updated correctly, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo vi /etc/ibm/sgenvironment.conf
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To check the status of your client installation, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dpkg --status ibm-securegateway-client
</code></pre></li>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Beginning with version 1.3.2, the Secure Gateway client provides native client installation support for Microsoft Windows.  The support is provided as an EXE installer.</p>
<h4 id="windows-installation-procedure">Windows Installation Procedure</h4>
<p>You may require administrative privileges to perform this installation, depending on your system&#39;s security setup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the EXE installer file to your system.  An MD5 sum is also provided which you can use to check the integrity of the installation package.</li>
<li><p>Install it by either double clicking on it and answering the prompts, or using the following command in a terminal session:</p>
<p>For instance, if you are running version 1.4.1 of the installer, use the following command:</p>
<p><code>ibm-securegateway-client-1.4.1+client_windows.exe</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>The user will be prompted to choose the installation directory of their choice. The default location is the Program Files (x86) directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The user will be prompted to select the language in which they want to launch the Command Line Interface. If not language is selected, it will be defaulted to English.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The user will be prompted to install the client as a windows service. If the user chooses to do so, the client will run in background as a windows service with the configurations user provide in the subsequent dialog. The status of service can be checked in the service page of Control Panel. The service name is &quot;IBM Bluemix Secure Gateway Service&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The installer identifies if there is an existing installation on the machine. If it is detected, the user is asked if they want to use the existing configurations, else the user has the option to enter new configurations. Details like gateway ids, security tokens, acl files and log level for each gateway can be provided here. If the user has chosen to run the client as a windows service the client will launch with the configurations provided. If the user has not chosen to launch the client as a windows service, the configurations will be stored for further use. In either case, the configurations are stored in %Installation_directory%/ibm/securegateway/client/securegw_service.config.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Starting version 1.5.0, the client comes with a fully functional client UI. You can configure it from the installer itself. The user can provide the password and the port number (default is 9003) from which the client UI will be launched.</p>
<p>If the user chooses to launch the client with connection to multiple gateways, please take care while providing the configuration values. The gateway ids needs to be separated by spaces. The security tokens, acl files and log levels should to be delimited by --. If you don&#39;t want to provide any of these three values for a particular gateway, please use &#39;none&#39;.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>Please ensure that there are no residual white spaces.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>Please note that the acl files should be placed in %Installation_directory%/ibm/securegateway/client directory or relative to that path.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="starting-the-client-as-a-process">Starting the Client as a process</h4>
<p>To start a client, open a command window with administrator privileges.</p>
<pre><code>    cd &quot;&lt;Installation_directory&gt;\ibm\securegateway\client&quot;

    secgw.cmd
</code></pre><p>or just double click on the secgw.cmd file.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can choose to use the configurations stored in securegw_service.config file or provide the details interactively.</p>
<h4 id="interacting-with-the-client-as-a-windows-service">Interacting with the client as a Windows service</h4>
<p>To alter the state of the windows service, open a command window with administrator privileges.</p>
<p>  <code>cd &quot;&lt;Installation_directory&gt;\ibm\securegateway\client&quot;</code></p>
<p>If the service is already running, the user can use the below command to stop it</p>
<p>  <code>windowsService.cmd uninstall</code></p>
<p>To start the service, use the following command</p>
<p>  <code>windowsService.cmd install</code></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The service will run based on the configurations stored in %Installation_directory%/ibm/securegateway/client/securegw_service.config. The application logs for windows service will be stored at %Installation_directory%/ibm/securegateway/client/logs/securegw_win_service.log. The logs are rolled into a new file on a daily basis.</p>
<h4 id="windows-uninstallation-procedure">Windows Uninstallation procedure</h4>
<p>  There are two ways to remove Windows installation for Secure Gateway client:</p>
<ol>
<li>Removing from the installation directory: Go to the installation directory for Secure gateway client and double-click on the uninstall.exe.</li>
<li>Removing from Control Panel: Remove the Secure Gateway application from the Programs section of the Control Panel.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="interacting-with-the-client">Interacting with the Client</h3>
<p>There are a few ways to interact with the client:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through terminal command line prior to startup</li>
<li>After startup, using the client&#39;s interactive command line</li>
<li>After startup, using the client&#39;s local UI</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="multi-gateway-functionality">Multi-gateway Functionality</h4>
<p>Previously, there were two modes of functionality: single-gateway and multi-gateway.  The single-gateway mode of functionality has been replaced by a transparent multi-gateway mode, meaning the <code>--multi</code> flag is no longer necessary during startup.  New gateway connections are still created as a child process of the initial client, but the newly connected client will be selected by default, making interaction nearly identical to the single-gateway mode.  If multiple gateways are connected, the user can interact with them via their worker ID, available through the command line.</p>
<h4 id="terminal-command-line-arguments-and-parameters">Terminal Command Line Arguments and Parameters</h4>
<p>The Secure Gateway client has command line parameters and arguments.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p> <b>Note:</b> <code>--service</code>, <code>--allow</code>, and <code>--noUI</code> flags should be the last parameters in the command line arguments.</p>
<p>In order to pass these to multiple gateway connections, they must be passed in using a specific format.  The gateway IDs can be passed in the same way as with the single-gateway client (with each gateway ID separated by a space); however, the order of these IDs determine the order the rest of the arguments must follow.  When passing in any of the other arguments, they must be separated by <code>--</code> in order to be picked up correctly.  If nothing is passed in for a particular flag, it is assumed to not apply to any of the gateways.  </p>
<p>If there aren&#39;t enough arguments supplied to fulfill all of the gateway IDs, then they will be applied in order until there are no more arguments.  For example, if two gateway IDs are passed in and a single security token is passed in, then the token will be applied to the first gateway ID and not the second one.  </p>
<p>If gateway IDs are provided that require different arguments, then the keyword <code>none</code> should be designated in the place of any particular argument that a gateway is not enforcing/supplying.  For example. if three gateway IDs are passed in and the user would like to specify a loglevel for the first and third, the argument would look like <code>--loglevel DEBUG--none--TRACE</code>.  In this case, none would then default to INFO.</p>
<p>As an example of a full command, this is how a connection command would look when attempting to connect two gateway on startup, where the first does not require a security token but the second does, where the first will be provided an ACL file and the second will not, and providing specific loglevels and logpaths to each:</p>
<pre><code>myGatewayID_1 myGatewayID_2 -t none--&lt;token for gateway 2&gt; -l DEBUG--TRACE -p &lt;full path to log file for gateway 1&gt;--&lt;full path to log file for gateway 2&gt; -F &lt;full path to ACL file for gateway 1&gt;
</code></pre><h4 id="internal-client-interactive-command-line-arguments-and-parameters">Internal Client Interactive Command Line Arguments and Parameters</h4>
<p>The Secure Gateway client has a command line interface (cli) and shell prompt for easy configuration and control. The interactive environment supports a richer sets of capabilities than the command line arguments, this is to facilitate better interactive control over the client.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-your-client-side-tls-connection">Configuring your client-side TLS connection</h3>
<p>If you want to extend TLS security all the way back to your on-premises or cloud resource such as your database, you can do so by enabling client TLS. This means that the resource would require TLS or that users can reach an HTTPS backend.</p>
<p>Enabling TLS security between the client and on-premises or cloud resource is separate to application-side TLS.  Application-side TLS secures access between your Bluemix app and the cloud environment client. You can use client-side TLS connectivity independent of application-side TLS, or vice versa, or together to provide complete security from your Bluemix app to your resource.</p>
<h3 id="access-control-list">Access Control List</h3>
<p>The Secure Gateway client provides embedded ACL support. You can allow or restrict (deny) access to on-premises resources by making modifications to the ACL for the client.  This can be done interactively using the client commands or specifying a file that contains the ACLs you want to have in affect.</p>
<p>Starting with v1.5.0, Access Control List rules will be synchronized across all clients connected to the same gateway.  With this, you only need to establish/update your ACL from a single client and it will be shared across all running clients connected to that gateway.  The ACL will also persist across sessions, such that connecting a new client will also apply the same ACL rules.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Starting with Secure Gateway Version 1.3.0 ACL DENY ALL is in affect until the user has supplied an ACL to allow access to on-premises resources.</p>
<h4 id="access-control-list-commands">Access Control List commands</h4>
<p>The supported ACL commands are:</p>
<pre><code>acl allow [&lt;hostname&gt;]:[&lt;port&gt;]
acl deny [&lt;hostname&gt;]:[&lt;port&gt;]
no acl [&lt;hostname&gt;]:[&lt;port&gt;]
no acl
show acl
</code></pre><p>The forms where you have left out either a hostname or port this implies all hostnames or ports.  For example, the following is an ACL rule to allow all hostnames for port 22.</p>
<pre><code>acl allow :22
</code></pre><p>The following is an ACL rule to allow all hostnames for all ports, essentially disabling ACL support, this is not recommended.</p>
<pre><code>acl allow :
</code></pre><p>The &apos;show acl&apos; command will show the currently set ACL or provide a message on the overall setting.</p>
<h4 id="http-s-route-control-using-the-acl">HTTP/S Route Control using the ACL</h4>
<p>Starting with v1.6.0, HTTP/S destinations can also enforce specific routes on the ACL entries.  These are added the same way as the typical ACL entries, but with the path appended to the end of the rule. For example, the following will allow only requests following the /my/api path to pass through:</p>
<pre><code>acl allow localhost:80/my/api
</code></pre><p>With this rule in place, requests to <code>&lt;cloud host&gt;:&lt;cloud port&gt;/my/api*</code> will be allowed through.</p>
<p>Routes are only supported on <code>acl allow</code> commands.</p>
<h4 id="access-control-list-precedence">Access Control List Precedence</h4>
<p>After providing an <code>acl allow :</code> command, if further <code>acl allow</code> commands are entered, the <code>ALL:ALL</code> allow rule (from <code>acl allow :</code>) will be removed from the list on the assumption that you no longer want to allow unbounded access.  After providing an <code>acl deny :</code> command, if another <code>acl deny</code> command is entered, the <code>ALL:ALL</code> deny rule (from <code>acl deny :</code>) will be removed from the list on the assumption that you no longer want to restrict all access.  If you list your current ACL rules via the <code>show acl</code> command in the CLI, there will be an indicator to display whether unlisted rules are being allowed or denied.</p>
<h4 id="access-control-list-acl-file">Access Control List (ACL) file</h4>
<p>The Secure Gateway client provides embedded ACL support. You can supply a filename that contains the supported ACL commands that will be read by the client upon startup. This file should have commands of the following<br>format:</p>
<pre><code>acl allow [&lt;hostname&gt;]:[&lt;port&gt;]
acl deny [&lt;hostname&gt;]:[&lt;port&gt;]
no acl [&lt;hostname&gt;]:[&lt;port&gt;]
no acl
</code></pre><p><b>Note:</b> &#39;no acl&#39; without any other parameters RESETS the ACL table and sets the access to DENY ALL.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please find a sample acl file in the client folder of the installation directory.</p>
<h5 id="copying-your-acl-file-into-the-secure-gateway-docker-client">Copying your ACL file into the Secure Gateway Docker client</h5>
<p>The Secure Gateway docker client essentially runs in it&#39;s own virtualization container.  The filesystem of the hosting machine is therefore not directly accessible to processes that run inside the container, including the Secure Gateway client.  Starting with version 1.8.0 of the Docker Engine, you can use the &#39;docker cp&#39; command to push files that exist on your host into the container while it is running or stopped.  This must be done in order to use the Secure Gateway client&#39;s ACL FILE interactive command.</p>
<p>To use the interactive &#39;cp&#39; support in docker from your host to the docker instance you must be at docker 1.8.0. You can check this using:</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre><p>Once you have done this, your version should display as follows. It is recommended that you allow docker to run as non-root user, so run the command that is suggested after you have upgraded you engine to 1.8.0 or 1.8.2.</p>

</code></pre><h3 id="bidirectional-support">Bidirectional Support</h3>
<p>By combining the traditional on-premises destination with the new cloud destination, we achieve complete bidirectional support.  The new cloud destination allows an on-premises service/application to send information/requests to a cloud application via the Secure Gateway Client.  When creating a new cloud destination, the destination will contain <code>resource host</code> (the hostname or IP of the cloud application), <code>resource port</code> (the port that the cloud application will be listening on), and <code>client port</code> (the port that the Secure Gateway Client will be listening on).  Once this destination is established, the on-premises service can then connect to the client port and begin sending data which will be sent through the client, to the Secure Gateway Server, and then to the specified cloud application.  These destinations support the following protocols:  TCP, UDP, TLS: Server Side, HTTP, and HTTPS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The client port that is provided for a destination must be unique within the associated gateway.  E.g., a single gateway cannot have two reverse destinations listening on port 12000, but two gateways can each have their own destination listening on port 12000.  However, in the latter case, if both of the gateways are connected to the same multi-gateway client, only one of the destinations will be able to listen on port 12000.</p>
<h4 id="reverse-destination">Reverse Destination</h4>
<p><img src="./DocImg/reverseDestination.png?raw=true" alt="Reverse Destination" title="Reverse Destination"></p>
<h4 id="on-premises-destination">On Premises Destination</h4>
<p><img src="./DocImg/onPremDestination.png?raw=true" alt="On Premises destination" title="On Premises Destination"></p>
<h3 id="high-availability">High Availability</h3>
<p>To achieve high availability, create multiple client connections to the same gateway ID.  This can be accomplished by connecting multiple single-gateway clients to the same gateway ID and/or by issuing multiple connections on a single multi-gateway client to the same gateway ID.  Connections will be distributed between all connected clients in a round-robin fashion.</p>
<h3 id="remote-client-termination">Remote Client Termination</h3>
<p>If a client has been provided an ID, then it can be remotely terminated via the SG UI or through the SG API.  If you terminate a client that is running as a service, the client will restart and obtain a new client ID; however, if the service has multiple clients connected, the terminated client will not restart until all of the remaining clients have been terminated.</p>
<h3 id="client-ui">Client UI</h3>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Client UI is not supported when using Docker on Windows or MacOS.</p>
<p>The client UI provides a web interface for the user to interact with the Secure Gateway Client rather than the CLI.  The UI is split into the following pages:</p>
<h4 id="connect">Connect</h4>
<p>This is the initial landing page for the UI where a user can provide a gateway ID and security token to connect their first client.</p>
<h4 id="login">Login</h4>
<p>This page will be displayed if the UI has been password protected.  If this page is reached while no password is being enforced, please refresh the page to be redirected.</p>
<h4 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h4>
<p>This is the main page once a client has been connected.  From here, you can access the View Logs page, the Access Control List page, and the Connection Info page.  At the bottom, you can also choose to disconnect one/many of the connected clients.  On the top of the page, the currently selected client will be displayed as well as an option to connect additional clients.</p>
<h4 id="view-logs">View Logs</h4>
<p>This page will allow you to see the logs being generated by the selected client (shown in the upper right of the page).  The displayed logs can be filtered by the check boxes below the logs.</p>
<h4 id="access-control-list">Access Control List</h4>
<p>This page will allow you to manipulate the Access Control List for the selected client (shown in the upper right of the page).  Rules can be individually added to the allow/deny tables or a file can be uploaded at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h4 id="connection-info">Connection Info</h4>
<p>This page will show the current connection information for the selected client (shown in the upper right of the page).  Information such as gateway description, number of current connections, and reverse destination listeners can be seen here.</p>
<h3 id="connection-limitations">Connection Limitations</h3>
<p>Our plans have the following concurrent limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard: 250 concurrent connections per client</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="datapower-client-limitations">DataPower Client Limitations</h3>
<p>The Secure Gateway DataPower Client is in the process of being updated to match the capabilities of the rest of our clients.  It currently has the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACL will default to ALLOW ALL</li>
<li>Does not support enabling/disabling gateways or destinations from the SG UI; however, the Administrative State option in the DataPower UI functions as an <code>on</code>/<code>off</code> switch for that particular client</li>
<li>Does not support Client High Availability through the connection of multiple clients to the same gateway</li>
<li>Does not support full certificate chains with destination-side TLS</li>
<li>Does not support connection status polling for real-time connected and disconnected gateway status updates</li>
<li>Does not support Cloud Destinations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>The following section is for troubleshooting issues that you may come across during client setup or operations.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-best-practices-for-running-the-secure-gateway-client">What are the best practices for running the Secure Gateway client</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run the Secure Gateway client on an operating system (OS) partition that has network visibility of the services that are bridged by the client itself. For instance, some hosted virtualization environments support multiple network connectivity modes, including NAT and Bridged. Be sure to choose the correct connection type that provides you with access to the IBM® Bluemix services from the internet.</li>
<li>Install the Secure Gateway into your IT environment where your corporate security policy allows. This would typically be in a protected yellow zone or DMZ where your company can institute the appropriate security controls to protect on-premises assets. Always follow your corporate security policies and instructions when you install the Secure Gateway client.</li>
<li>Before you install a client into your environment, ensure that both the internet and your on-premises assets are accessible and all host names are resolvable by a DNS. The client uses outbound port 443 and port 9000 to connect to the IBM Bluemix environment. Ensure you check or modify additional firewall and IP Table rules that might apply</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-is-happening">What is happening</h4>
<p>When you restart the server where your Secure Gateway client runs, you must manually restart the Secure Gateway Docker client. How can you get the client to start automatically after a restart of the system?</p>
<h4 id="how-to-fix-it">How to fix it</h4>
<ul>
<li>On Linux or UNIX systems:<ul>
<li>Integrate the Docker command into a script that can be called as a result of a CRON job.</li>
<li>If you are using a Linux work station, you can create an upstart configuration to ensure that the client is started every time that the server is restarted. For more information, see Automatically Start Containers in the Docker website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Windows systems, issue the following command to start the client:<pre><code>for /L %i in (0,0,0) do docker run -it ibmcom/secure-gateway-client &lt;gateway_id&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connection-error-message-host-lt-host-name-gt-is-not-cert-apos-s-cn-lt-mycommonname-gt-">Connection error message: Host: &lt;host name&gt;. is not cert&apos;s CN: &lt;mycommonname&gt;</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-happening">What is happening</h4>
<p>You are trying to implement on-premises client-side TLS by using the Secure Gateway client and you receive the following error message.</p>
<pre><code>[ERROR] Connection #&lt;connection ID&gt; had error: Host: &lt;host name&gt;. is not cert&#39;s CN: &lt;mycommonname&gt;Where:

    connection ID is a client assigned connection number.
    host name is the host name for the connection.
    mycommonname is the FDQN or common name that is used in the certificate.
</code></pre><h4 id="why-it-is-happening">Why it is happening</h4>
<p>The Common Name, for example, the server FQDN or YOUR name, between your on-premises application and the certificate that you uploaded into Bluemix for this destination do not match.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the following items:<ul>
<li>You generated the certificate correctly and that you used the correct server FQDN or host name.</li>
<li>You uploaded the correct certificate into your Bluemix destination for this client.<h4 id="how-to-fix-it">How to fix it</h4>
</li>
<li>In the Bluemix UI, go to the Secure Gateway Dashboard.</li>
<li>Select your destination and click the Edit icon.</li>
<li>Click Upload certificate.</li>
<li>Upload the PEM certificate file that is to be used to connect to the on-premises system.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-is-happening">What is happening</h4>
<p>Due to hostname resolution issues we are using the IP address in our destination.  The CN in the certificate presented is the IP address of the gateway, but the certificate does not have a SAN matching the IP address and the client fails to connect<br>You have created a destination using TLS, but instead of using the destination&apos;s hostname you have used it&apos;s IP address.  When connecting the client the following error is being thrown.</p>
<pre><code>[2015-10-15 13:00:04.866] [INFO] Connection #0 is being established to 10.3.20.31:443

</code></pre><h4 id="why-it-is-happening">Why it is happening</h4>
<p>What is going on is that the SSL verification code in the gateway client is treating this destination differently because it uses an IP address rather than a hostname.  Instead of matching with the cert&#39;s CN, it is looking in the cert&#39;s SAN for a match of the IP address.  Since there is no SAN in the cert, it sees it as a bad connection and fails the SSL handshake.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-fix-it">How to fix it</h4>
<p>If you look at the error message it does not say CN, (e.g. [ERROR] Connection # had error: Host: . is not cert&apos;s CN: ), but the cert&apos;s list, which leads me to believe you have generated your self-signed cert incorrectly. The problem is generating the cert using an FQDN or CN with an IP_Address. This will not work since IP addresses are only supported when using SAN.</p>
<p>Method for generating a certificate with an IP as the CN with openssl:</p>
<ol>
<li>create an openssl config file, I copied mine from /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf</li>
<li><p>Add an alternate_names section to the file like below:</p>
<p>[ alternate_names ]</p>
<p>IP.1 = &lt;my application&apos;s ip&gt;</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the [ v3_ca ] section, add this line:</p>
<p>subjectAltName = @alternate_names</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under the CA_default section, uncomment copy_extensions (extension copying option: use with caution):</p>
<p>copy_extensions = copy</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gen private key</p>
<p>openssl genrsa -out private.key 3072</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gen certificate with options about organization</p>
<p>openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -sha256 -out certificate.pem -days 730 -config</p>
</li>
<li><p>Combine the files</p>
<p>cat private.key certificate.pem &gt; SAN.pem</p>
</li>
<li><p>Load the SAN.pem file into your destination as the client-TLS cert.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Load the SAN.pem file into your on-premises application and restart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your destination can be configured for either TCP, HTTP or HTTPS and you cloud side application should now be able to connect to your on-premises application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you encounter an UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE problem, check your openssl.conf file, change the following from:</p>
<p>keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment</p>
<p>to the default:</p>
<p>keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment</p>
